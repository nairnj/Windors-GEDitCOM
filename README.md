# Windors-GEDitCOM

This repository contains a <b>GEDitCOM II</b> file (and one that is also compatible with <b>GEDitCOM</b>) for descendants of Queen Elizabeth II.

To learn about these applications, visit <a href="http://www.geditcom.com">geditcom.com</a>.

For those not working on a Mac or not using <b>GEDitCOM II</b> or <b>GEDitCOM</b>, this repository contains a complete GEDCOM file titled <code>Windors.ged</code> along with linked image files in the <code>multimedia</code> folder. Links in the GEDCOM file to multimedia objects are set up for viewing in <b>GEDitCOM II</b> or <b>GEDitCOM</b>. If you want to view the file in other software, the following steps will work (if you are using decent GEDCOM software):

1. Copy <code>Windsors.ged</code> to a different folder
2. Copy the entire <code>multimedia</code> file to the same folder
3. Import that GEDCOM file to any application that claims to import GEDCOM data

The above process has the linked by a valid methods using relative path names the file in the <code>multimedia</code> folder. If the software you use doess not find multimedia objects, it link is not try to import multimedia.
