# Windors-GEDitCOM

This repository contains a <b>GEDitCOM II</b> file (and one that is also compatible with <b>GEDitCOM</b>) for descendants of Queen Elizabeth II. In the repository, the genealogy file looks like a folder, but when viewed on the Mac, the entire folder is a MacOS package that can be opened and viewed in <b>GEDitCOM II</b> or <b>GEDitCOM</b>. To learn about these applications, visit <a href="http://www.geditcom.com">geditcom.com</a>.

For those not working on a Mac or not using <b>GEDitCOM II</b> or <b>GEDitCOM</b>, this repository contains a complete GEDCOM file titled <code>Windors.ged</code> along with linked image files in the <code>multimedia</code> folder. Links in the GEDCOM file to multimedia objects are set up for viewing in <b>GEDitCOM II</b> or <b>GEDitCOM</b>. If you want to view the file in other software, the following steps should work (if you are using decent GEDCOM software):

1. Copy <code>Windsors.ged</code> to a different folder
2. Copy the entire <code>multimedia</code> file to the same folder
3. Import that GEDCOM file to any application that claims to import GEDCOM data

This file is 100% valid GEDCOM data, but does use some custom tags. If the importing software has problems, that software may have limitations in their GEDCOM support. Most software will work, but many will fail to find the multimedia objects. The above process has all images linked by a valid method using relative path names to the file in the <code>multimedia</code> folder. If the software you use does not find any multimedia objects, it is likely not support import of multiemdia objects.
